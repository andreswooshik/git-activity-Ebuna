Git and GitHub activity for my Soft Engineering 1

## Git Activity 1

Name: Ralf Andre Ebu√±a  
Course/Year: BSIT - 3rd Year  

What I Learned:
I learned that Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code, while GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts repositories for collaboration. I now understand how to initialize, commit, and push changes to GitHub. This activity taught me how developers manage and share code efficiently.
